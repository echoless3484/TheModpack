The Modpack (Formerly Echo's Workbenches+)

Description
The Modpack is a mod made by Rowan, Nika. (Mr. B), Toastery and Echoless that improves many corners of the game, it improves almost every sound courtesy of Toastery, replaces the existing character weapons with a Kriss Vector, ACR, and Colt 1911 courtesy of Nika. (Mr. B), makes almost every workbench bigger and better while adding a few new ones, and finally removing all of the workshop templates.

Included Edits
All workbenches have been made bigger, so every island with a workbench.
